# Editorial Project
This project contains editorial information about how projects, build and release process are set up.

## Release Process

The release process of the libraries is described in detail on Denis' blog article ["How To Set Up a Continuous Integration Process in the Cloud"](http://blog.grammarcraft.de/2016/04/23/set-up-a-continuous-integration-process-in-the-cloud/).

## Passwords and Keys

The passwords and cryptographic keys used in this release process are stored in the Keepass database file [editorial/JavaPOSWorkingGroup.kdbx](JavaPOSWorkingGroup.kdbx) in this proejct. For accessing this file, the Keepass application has to be downloaded and installed from http://keepass.info/download.html. There are different ports for a bunch of operating systems available.

The password to this Keepass database file is known to the committee members; in case of questions ask Denis.

The passwords for release process relevant steps are stored in the root of the Keepass database.
